## Geographical Voting Visualization
### Kentucky General Assembly, 2017

This app visualizes the voting patterns of legislators during the 2017 Kentucky General Assembly.  Select a bill, choose a vote and chamber, and the legislators who voted in the way you selected will be filled in the map.  The color of the fill corresponds with the party of the legislator (Democrats are blue, Republicans are red).

This app was built using the [derby-pie-politics API](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/louisville-hackathon-mar2017/blob/master/endpoints_proposal.md) built in Spring 2017 during the [Data For Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org/) Hackathon.  An extract of this database is hosted on [data.world](https://data.world/rkahne/2017-kentucky-general-assembly); this app uses that extract to build these choropleths.  The data in this project is all scraped from the [Kentucky Legislative Research Commission](http://www.lrc.ky.gov/) website.  The LRC also produced the shapefiles.  Many volunteers came together to transform this data into something that could produce this project -- there might be errors.  If you see any, please reach out to me at rkahne (at) gmail.com or on twitter [@rkahne](https://twitter.com/rkahne).

Unfortunately, we did not include bill descriptions in our API.  For information about bills, please visit the [LRC's legislation website](http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Legislation.htm). For information about which bills are particularly interesting, a good place to start is the [My Old Kentucky Podcast Medium](https://medium.com/my-old-kentucky-podcast).

Many thanks to the dozens of folks who came together during the hackathon to build the data for this project.
